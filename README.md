# SpaceX
Home Challenge

Please notice the purpose of this test is to see how you code. If you thing you have something similar which covers below, you can share it instead of doing the test.
 Create an app that uses the SpaceX API to load up a list of Rockets and displays the following information:
Name
Image
Success rate badge coloured accordingly to the percentage 
60-100% green
30-59% orange
0-29% red
Date of first flight formatted

Each item should be clickable and when clicked, the app should open a detailed page (use SwiftUI to create this page) of the Rocket displaying:
Name
Image
Success rate badge coloured accordingly to the percentage 
60-100% green
30-59% orange
0-29% red
If active or not
Country
Description
Date of first flight formatted
Cost per launch formatted in US dollars
A button to open up the Wikipedia page

Both pages must have a progress indicator to inform about any ongoing loading.

The app must be written in Swift and use the following libraries/patterns:
Alamofire 
MVVM
Customize first page to support iPad using size classes
Autolayout
CoreData

Nice to have:
GCD or Operation 
Using combine framework
Unit Test

The code should be uploaded to a public GIT repository  ***** Mandatory; please complete the code with downloading the image with Operation, use core data to store cache, use MVVM,  cover unit test for all view-models
